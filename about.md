<p>I am a PhD student at the University of TÃ¼bingen and part of the International Max-Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS). My supervisor is Prof Dr Jakob Macke.<br/>
I build probabilistic machine learning tools for real-world problems, especially for neuroscience research. More specifically, I work on simulation-based (aka likelihood-free) Bayesian inference using neural density estimation.</p>
My main interests are:
- Bayesian inference
- Neural density estimation
- Uncertainty quantification
- Computational neuroscience
