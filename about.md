<p>I am a PhD student at the University of Tuebingen and part of the International Max-Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS). My supervisor is Prof Dr Jakob Macke.<br/>
My main goal is to build statistical machine learning tools for neuroscience research. I currently work on simulation-based (aka likelihood-free) inference using neural density estimators.</p>
