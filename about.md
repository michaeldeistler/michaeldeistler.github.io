<p>I am doing my Master studies in Neuroengineering at the Technical University of Munich.
More specifically, I am interested in the formation of memory and the emergence of stable patterns in (spiking) neural networks. To better understand these processes, I use models of brain function on different scales, ranging from multicompartment models to
fully artificial neurons in artificial neural networks.<br/>
I am always happy to discuss any of the above topics or other controversial topics in neuroscience and related fields, so feel free to contact me.</p>
