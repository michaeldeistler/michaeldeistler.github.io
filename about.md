<p>I am a M.Sc. student in Neuroengineering at the Technical University of Munich.
My main interest lies in the application of Machine Learning methods to neural or other biological data to uncover computational principles of biology. At the moment, I am writing my master's thesis on 'Bayesian inference on the pyloric rhythm' in the lab of Jakob Macke.<br/>
I am always happy to discuss any of the above or other controversial topics in neuroscience and related fields, so feel free to contact me.</p>
