<p>I am doing my Master studies in Neuroengineering at the Technical University of Munich.
More specialized, I am interested in how the brain maintains its function and activity on a
certain level and thereby is able to produce stable outputs. To achieve this goal, I work on
the modelling of brain function on different scales, ranging from multicompartment models to
fully artificial neurons in artificial neural networks. My longterm goal is to help cure neurological
diseases through inhanced understanding of the brain's functionality.</p>
