<p>I am doing my Master studies in Neuroengineering at the Technical University of Munich.
More specialized, I am interested in how the brain maintains its function and activity on a
certain level and thereby is able to produce stable outputs. To achieve this goal, I work on
the modelling of brain function on different scales, ranging from multicompartment models to
fully artificial neurons in artificial neural networks.
I am always happy to discuss any of the above topics or other controversial topics in neuroscience and related fields, so feel free to contact me.</p>
