<p>I am a M.Sc. student in Neuroengineering at the Technical University of Munich.
I am interested in various areas of Machine Learning, most notably Likelihood-free Inference, Normalizing Flows, and Gaussian Processes. At the moment, I am writing my master's thesis in the lab of Prof Dr Jakob Macke.<br/>
I am always happy to discuss any of the above topics, so feel free to contact me.</p>
