## Introduction
The Bernstein Conference for computational neuroscience 2018 took place in Berlin and gathers several of the world's most renowned theoretical Neuroscientists. I attended the conference to get into discussion with experts working on the formation of memory, the underlying synaptic and homeostatic mechanisms and in general the role of spikes in information processing as perform by neural networks, as I am hoping to pick up some of the learnt approaches for my Master thesis.

## Attended Workshops
I thereby attended the following two workshops and heard intriguing talks by the following speakers:
# Learning and recall of sequences
* Claudia Clopath: One-shot learning of sequences in hippocampus
* Wulfram Gerstner: Synfire chains are fast, easy, and costly: the challenge of slow sequences in spiking neural networks
* Jochen Triesch: Sequence learning in self-organizing recurrent neural networks
* Daniel Miner: Hey, look over there: the influence of distractors on sequence replay in trained recurrent networks
* Juliane Herpich: Constraints on the input-dependent self-organization of cell assembly sequences
# Emergent function in non-random networks.
* Aditya Gilra: Local stable learning of forward and inverse dynamics in spiking neural networks
* Robert GÃ¼tig: Margin learning in spiking neurons
* Claudia Clopath: Plasticity underlying non-random connectivity in cortical circuits
* Friedemann Zenke: Training deep spiking neural networks with surrogate gradients
* Christian Marton: Task representation & learning in prefrontal cortex & striatum as a dynamical system
