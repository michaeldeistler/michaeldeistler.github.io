## Introduction
In this course project, Yagmur Yener and I investigated the potential how tactile hallucinations can emerge through homeostasis. For this, we use artificial skin from the Institute for Cognitive Systems at TUM and leverage previous work on the Charles Bonnet Syndrome (Series, Reichert, and Storkey, NIPS, 2010)

## Results
We are currently working towards a publication of this work and will disclose the results then.
