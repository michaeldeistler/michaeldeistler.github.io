## Introduction
During my research project at the Max-Planck-Institute for Brain Research in Julijana Gjorgjieva's group, the institute's bi-annual retreat took place. The retreat beautifully managed to bridge the gap between experimental neuroscience and the theoretical modeling of these processes.

## Participating groups
Julijana Gjorgjieva (Computation in Neural Circuits)
Gilles Laurent
Erin Schuman
Hiroshi Ito
Tatjana Tchumatchenko
Moritz Helmstaedter
Johannes Letzkus
