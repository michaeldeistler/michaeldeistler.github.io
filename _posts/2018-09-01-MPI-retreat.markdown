## Introduction
During my research project at the Max-Planck-Institute for Brain Research in Julijana Gjorgjieva's group, the institute's biannual retreat took place. The retreat thereby helped in exchanging knowledge between the experimental and the theoretical neuroscientists at the institute.

## Participating groups
* Moritz Helmstaedter (Connectomics)
* Gilles Laurent (Computation in the three-layered cerebral cortex)
* Erin Schuman (Synaptic Plasticity)
* Hiroshi Ito (Memory and Navigation Circuits)
* Tatjana Tchumatchenko (Theory of Neural Dynamics)
* Johannes Letzkus (Neocoritical Circuits)
* Julijana Gjorgjieva (Computation in Neural Circuits)
