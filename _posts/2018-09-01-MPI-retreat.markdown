## Introduction
During my research project at the Max-Planck-Institute for Brain Research in Julijana Gjorgjieva's group, the institute's bi-annual retreat took place. The retreat beautifully managed to bridge the gap between experimental neuroscience and the theoretical modeling of these processes.

## Participating groups
Moritz Helmstaedter (Connectomics)
Gilles Laurent (Computation in three-layered cerebral cortex)
Erin Schuman (Synaptic Plasticity)
Hiroshi Ito (Memory and Navigation Circuits)
Tatjana Tchumatchenko (Theory of Neural Dynamics)
Johannes Letzkus (Neocoritical Circuits)
Julijana Gjorgjieva (Computation in Neural Circuits)
